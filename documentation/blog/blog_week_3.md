# Week 3 - Software Requirements Specification

A project can only acchieve astonishing success if the planning aspect is also done in a lengthily manner. As of this week we are happy to present you our Software Requirements Specification. It aims to keep ther Fridgify team organised and focused to acchieve something great. But the most important factor for us are our users. We want to give them all functionalities they diserve. We created an Overall Use Case Diagram to keep up to this promise. 
So without further ado we present you our Software Requirements Specification and the Overall Use Case Diagram.
