## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

### 1.2 Scope
This document describes the technical architecture of the **Fridgify** project, including the structure of classes, modules, dependencies and server/client.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

| REST | **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems \[1\]
| API | Application Programming Interface connects *client* and *server*. \[2\] |
| Application Store |  A mobile application store, where users can get the application (e.g. App Store, Play Store)
| OS | Operating System

### 1.5 Overview
This document contains the Architectural Representation, Goals and Constraints as well as the Logical, Deployment, Implementation and Data Views.

## 2 Architectural Representation
![Architectural Representation](./architecture.png)

## 3 Architectural Goals and Constraints
In the backend we decided to use Django. Django allows us to utilize MVC in an easy and comprehendible way. Database tables are mapped to models, which are controlled by controllers, called handlers in our case, and are presented as HTTP and JSON responses.\
Our frontend is developed in Flutter, which allows an easy way to distribute our software to different platforms.\
Backend and frontend are being developed seperately, allowing them to live in a *separate eco-system* and being independent from one another.
